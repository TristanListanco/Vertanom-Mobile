**Abstract**
This paper presents a two-part approach. Part 1 explores the application of Object-Oriented Programming
(OOP) using the Apple Swift and SwiftUI Framework to address high demand of onions in the city,lack of land
resources, higher inflation rates among basic goods and lack of innovative knowledge in agricultural
practices. We leverage core OOP concepts to provide a solution through the Qt framework. Part 2 validates
this approach by observing the increasing rate of production of onions in the Philippines from 2012 - 2022
(Philippine Statistics Authority, 2022) and the direct relation of various climatic data to plant growth vs time
(Statista, 2023) and a problem/opportunity table. This project is aligned to the UNâ€™s Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG 2) as it will reduce the reliance on imported onions, Improved availability and
consistency of onion supply in the local market in the region and adoption of advanced farming technologies
and practices. resulting in empowerment of small-scale farmers and agricultural cooperatives and
strengthened local food systems in the Region. The paper concludes by demonstrating how OOP with Qt
can create a simple Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that could potentially solve the problem, generate new
revenue streams, and serve as a foundation for future technological solutions.
